# Alfido-Tech-Internship

Name : Deepak Thapa
company : Alfido Tech Internship
Domain : C/C++ programming
Duration : 1 july to 31 july

1. Introduction

This report presents the work I completed during my summer internship, which focused on solving practical programming problems using C and C++. The internship tasks helped me strengthen my knowledge of core programming concepts such as control structures, loops, functions, and arrays.

The project was divided into three major tasks:

1. Building a Simple Calculator
2. Printing Even Numbers using Loops & Conditions
3. Finding the Largest Number in an Array using Functions

2. Objectives

To apply theoretical knowledge of C/C++ into practical coding tasks.
To develop problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
To understand the use of switch-case, loops, conditional statements, arrays, and functions.
To handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).

3. Tasks Completed

Task 3: Arrays & Functions

Description: Developed a C++ program to find the largest element in a user-defined array.
Concepts Used: Arrays, functions, iteration, user input handling.
Key Feature: Function findLargest() was created for code reusability.

4. Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++
IDE/Compiler: Code::Blocks / Dev C++ / g++ compiler
Operating System: Windows
Improved skills in problem decomposition and modular programming.

Gained confidence in applying theoretical knowledge into working solutions.
